# UnibsDown

## Saves Microsoft Stream videos uploaded by UniversitÃ  degli studi di Brescia.

This project was originally based on https://github.com/sup3rgiu/PoliDown

Improvements in this fork:
 - Unibs autologin

## PREREQS

* [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/it/download/): anything above v8.0 seems to work.
* [**aria2**](https://github.com/aria2/aria2/releases): this needs to be in your `$PATH` (for example, copy aria2c.exe to c:\windows). UnibsDown calls `aria2c` with a bunch of arguments in order to improve the download speed.
* [**ffmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html): a recent version (year 2019 or above), in [`$PATH`](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows-10).

## Windows Installation instructions
From orginal work PoliDown.
(On others OS is pretty much the same)\
**N.B:** ffmpeg.zeranoe.com closed since Sep 18, 2020. If you are following the video tutorial, download ffmpeg from another source available on [ffmpeg site](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (nightly build is no more required)

Multiple videos download:
```
$ node unibs.js -u CODICEPERSONA
    -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1"
                "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-2"
                "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-3"
```

Download from TXT file (one link each line):
```
$ node unibs.js -u CODICEPERSONA -f "/my/path/here/links.txt"
```

Define default video quality [0-5] (avoid manual prompt for each video):
```
$ node unibs.js -u CODICEPERSONA -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -q 4
```

Output directory (relative or absoulte path):
```
$ node unibs.js -u CODICEPERSONA -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -o "/my/path/here"
```

Replace saved password
```
$ node unibs.js -u CODICEPERSONA -p MYNEWPASSWORD -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1"
```

Do not use system keyring to save the password:
```
$ node unibs.js -u CODICEPERSONA -v "https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/VIDEO-1" -k
```


You can omit the password argument. Unibs will ask for it interactively and then save it securely in system's keychain for the next use.

### SCRIPT USAGE

Fill in the required fields in the `.sh` \ `.bat` script (according to your OS: `.sh` for MacOS/Linux, `.bat` for Windows).

Example (Windows):
```
@echo off
rem Put your settings in place of the dots
rem Remember! Assignment is space-sensitive!
 
set unibsdown_folder_path="C:\MyFolder\AnotherFolder\UnibsDown"
set codice_persona=10026431
set urls_file_path="C:\Users\supergiu\Desktop\links.txt"
set output_folder_path="C:\Users\supergiu\Desktop"
set quality_number=4

cd /D %unibsdown_folder_path%
node unibs.js -u %codice_persona% -f %urls_file_path% -o %output_folder_path% -q %quality_number%
@echo.
@echo Press any key to terminate . . .
@pause >nul
```

Then:
* for Windows, double click on the `.bat` script and enjoy
* for MacOS/Linux, `.sh` script needs to be made executable (`chmod 777` command or just set properly flag in file properties). Then, run it with Terminal
